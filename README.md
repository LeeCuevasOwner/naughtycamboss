# naughtycamboss

A simple React front-end inspired by camsharks.com.

## Development

This project uses CDN-hosted React and Babel for quick setup. To run the site locally you need Node.js installed.

Install dependencies (only `serve` is required for the dev server):

```bash
npm install serve
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
